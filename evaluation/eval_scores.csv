"2 weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization for unstable angina pectoris, the patient presented with decreased urinary output and malaise. His symptoms were initially controlled with a multivitamin, but he developed generalized malaise and weakness after a few days. The patient was started on fluticasone, clopidogrel, and metoprolol, but his symptoms persisted. A detailed workup revealed an obstructive nodule in the left renal artery. Despite this, the patient was given an additional 24-hour course of the antibiotic used in the initial treatment of the cardiac event. Which of the following is most likely to occur as a side effect of the drug administered to the patient?""

Options:
{'A': 'Decreased renal blood flow', 'B': 'Increased serum ampicillin resistance', 'C': 'Decreased serum tetracycline absorption', 'D': 'Increased chance of hemolytic anemia', 'E': 'Decreased serum propranolol absorption'}

"<h2>Genetic Mutation and Medical Conditions</h2> <p>Merlin (MRN 22104) is a gene on chromosome 22 that encodes a tumor suppressor protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with several types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, vascular malformations, and telangiectasias. The type of cancer produced by the mutation in this patient will not be predictable based on other factors such as age, sex, or mode of delivery.</p> <p>Renal cell carcinoma (A) is a well-known malignancy caused by mutations in the catkinin gene.</p> <p>Meningioma (B) refers to an unknown tumor that can occur in any nervous system structure and typically does not have a typical prognosis.</p> <p>Astrocytoma (C) is a rare form of brain cancer caused by mutations in the p53 gene.</p> <p>Vascular malformations (D) are associated with genes such as HLA-CLL, which are involved in vascular claudication and vascular squamous cell carcinoma.</p> <p>Telangiectasias (E) is a rare form of cerebral laceration that can progress to hematoma and hydrocephalus.</p>",Meningioma,The answer correctly identifies meningioma as a condition associated with Merlin mutations.,5
